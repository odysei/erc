\section{Methodology}

\note{
Describe the proposed methodology in detail including any key
intermediate goals. Explain and justify the methodology in relation
to the state of the art, and particularly novel or unconventional
aspects addressing the 'high-risk/high-gain' balance. Highlight any
intermediate stages where results may require adjustments to the
project planning. In case you ask that team members are engaged by
another host institution their participation has to be fully
justified by the scientific added value they b ring to the project.
