\section{Extended Synopsis}

\note{5 pages\\
  This should be a concise presentation of the full scientific proposal, with
  particular attention to the ground-breaking nature of the research project
  and the feasibility of the outlined scientific approach. At step 1 the full
  scientific proposal is not assessed so all essential information must be
  covered in the synopsis. The applicant will choose a primary evaluation panel
  and may also indicate a secondary evaluation panel.  He/she should indicate
  when they believe that their proposal is of a cross-panel or cross-domain
  nature.
